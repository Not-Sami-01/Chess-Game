# My Chess Game Project (Still Working on It - Incomplete)

This project is a personal endeavor aimed at enhancing my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of game development. The chess game implements the classic rules of chess.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you want to customize the build tool and configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts for you to modify. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to use `eject`; the curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments.
